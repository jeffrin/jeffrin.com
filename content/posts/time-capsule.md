I received an account reactivation notice from Penzu.com, a private journal service. Having forgotten this ever existed, I unlocked the journal and found 3 posts: a blank one dated Dec 15, 2013 when I presumably started the journal, and the two included below, un-edited. 

These were written in Berkeley, while I was engrossed in my video production business, ThenFound. The month prior I participated in my first and only WrestleMania weekend, in my home town, with Cait at my side the whole time. In June, we held a shockingly profitable garage sale to clear out the knickknacks of my childhood home. And that August, Mom Swiffered the living room floor for the last time. Enjoy:

> Today I headed to Marin to run errands and continue work on the videos. First went to the Marin County Superior Court building, where I had previously been to shoot Rosie's wedding. An early paid gig from back in the day. After realizing a traffic court hearing probably wouldn't be worth the time, I paid the speeding ticket and the driving school FEE. Bye, $422.

> Dropped by Ray's place in Kentfield, he's a construction worker that has a photographer/videographer streak in him. Best I can tell he lives alone in his flat on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, and his living room walls are a shrine to his daughter. In the middle of admiring the photos Ray revealed that the 9 or 10 year old subject was now a 27-year-old. It was somewhat jarring in that the photos are of such high quality, that they may as well have been taken days ago.

> Around 11:20 it was time to tackle San Anselmo - The Video. I started at a known location that I needed the signage for — the local activities/recreation center or what have you. From there I started exploring the residential areas, grabbing shots of houses that jumped out. There's a heightened feeling of being exposed that I didn't experience as much filming in San Francisco. In the City we're so accustomed to seeing a knight in full tin foil armor making his commute on MUNI, a guy with a camera may as well be a MUNI driver.

> Forgot to pack food for the shoot. I have to stop that shit and make sure to have an apple and water or something.

> Meals for the day: deep dish pizza, cheese bread sticks, tonkatsu ramen with chicken, snap peas, and egg, glazed donut and half a cinnamon bun from King Pin Donuts 
>
> Day 21 of HIIT, bitches! That's a total of 51 days of exercise in the last 54 days — a 3-day recovery period for a stupid back injury has been my only break. It's almost certainly the most consecutive days of exercise I've had in my life, with the main contender being the BALL IS LIFE days circa 97-99. Feck I'm old.

> Quite a bit of writing can be done in 15 minutes. Perhaps tomorrow I'll find a prompt to work off of, or maybe more of this shoot-style journal. Who knows? What I know is this is a simple way for me to remind future Jeff that I existed; that I did things, didn't do others, and cared enough to remember.
